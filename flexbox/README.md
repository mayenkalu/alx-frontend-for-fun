# Flexbox

Flexbox is a CSS layout module that enables flexible and efficient arrangement of elements within a container, allowing easy control over their positioning and alignment.

To convert float positioning to a flex display, set the container's display property to "flex" and adjust any additional flex properties as needed, providing a more modern and responsive layout approach.

Horizontally and vertically aligning elements using Flexbox can be achieved by setting the container's "justify-content" property for horizontal alignment and "align-items" property for vertical alignment.

The main axis is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out, defined by the "flex-direction" property, while the cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis.

Properties that work on flex elements include "flex-grow", "flex-shrink" and "flex-basis" whereas properties like "display", "flex-direction" and "flex-wrap" are used on the flex container.

Shorthands for flex properties include "flex-flow" for combining "flex-direction" and "flex-wrap" and "flex" for combining "flex-grow", "flex-shrink" and "flex-basis".

To create a new page with Flexbox in mind, design the layout using flex containers and items, leveraging the flexibility and responsiveness of Flexbox to create a fluid and adaptive design.
