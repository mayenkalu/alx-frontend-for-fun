# Sass & Scss

**Sass** (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that extends CSS. It introduces features like variables, nested rules, mixins, and more, to make writing and managing CSS code more efficient and maintainable.

*Writing Sass & Scss Files:*
Sass files use the .sass extension and have a more concise syntax without curly braces or semicolons. SCSS files use the .scss extension and have a syntax similar to CSS with additional features. You write your styles in either of these formats and then compile them into regular CSS for use in web development.

*Difference Between Sass and SCSS:*
Sass and SCSS are two syntaxes for Sass. SCSS uses a syntax similar to CSS, making it easier for developers familiar with CSS to transition. Sass, on the other hand, uses indentation and doesn't require semicolons or curly braces.

*Sass Preprocessing:*
Sass preprocessing involves converting your Sass/SCSS files into regular CSS files using a Sass compiler. This process allows you to use the advanced features of Sass while generating browser-compatible CSS.

*Declaring a Variable:*
Variables in Sass allow you to store values that you can reuse throughout your stylesheets. To declare a variable, use the $ symbol followed by the variable name and the value.

*Using Nested Definitions:*
Sass lets you nest CSS rules inside one another, which helps maintain a logical structure and reduces repetition. For example:

```scss
.container {
    width: 100%;
    .content {
        font-size: 16px;
    }
}
```

*Importing a Sass File:*
You can use the `@import` directive to include other Sass files into your current file. This is useful for breaking your styles into manageable modules.

*Using Mixins:*
Mixins are reusable blocks of code that can be included in multiple places. They are defined using the @mixin directive and used with the @include directive.

*Declaring Extend/Inheritance Styles:*
The @extend directive allows you to share styles between selectors. It's a way of inheriting styles from one selector to another.

*Manipulating Operators:*
Sass supports various operators (+, -, *, /) that allow you to perform arithmetic operations on numeric values and even color values.

Sass enhances your CSS workflow by providing a set of tools that streamline and improve the way you write and organize your styles.
